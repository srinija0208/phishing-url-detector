# üé£ Phishing URL Detector

## üìå Model Description  

This project is a machine learning web app that detects whether a given URL is potentially phishing or reliably legitimate. It combines **character-level TF-IDF n-grams** with **engineered numerical features** to make predictions.  

Three models were tested: 

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **XGBoost**  

The **best model was selected based on recall**, since reducing false negatives (phishing URLs classified as safe) is the highest priority.  

---

## Current Best Model

  -- XGBoost with 

**Recall** = 0.9910
**Precision** = 0.9968 
**Accuracy** = 0.9961 

## ‚úÖ Intended Uses & ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations  

### Intended Uses 

- Detect phishing URLs in security applications (browsers, firewalls, email filters).  
- Demonstration of phishing detection for educational or research purposes.  

### Limitations  

- Model selection focused on **recall** ‚Üí may lead to higher **false positives**.  
- Limited to **top 1000 n-grams** ‚Üí some rare phishing tricks may not be captured.  
- No **domain-level metadata** (e.g., WHOIS, SSL, DNS info).

## üõ†Ô∏è Training Procedure  

- **Data:**  
  - `phishing_dataset.csv` ‚Üí Phishing URLs.  
  - `url_dataset.csv` ‚Üí Legitimate URLs.  

- **Split:**  
  Train-test split (80:20) with stratification.  

- **Preprocessing:**  
  - `TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000, analyzer="char", ngram_range=(2,5))`  
  - `StandardScaler()` for numerical features  

- **Validation:**  
  Stratified 5-fold cross-validation  

- **Metric:**  
  Recall (primary), with precision and accuracy for reference

## Tech Stack
- Python
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Gradio

## üöÄ Demo & Usage

Try the application directly in the Space interface!

- **Enter URL:** Paste the complete URL you wish to check.

- **Analyze:** Click the Analyze URL button.

- **Review:** The app displays the final classification (Phishing/Legitimate) and the associated probability score.

- **Clear:** Use the Clear button to reset the fields for a new test.


- **Prediction:** Binary classification (1=Phishing, 0=Legitimate).

- **Best Model:** Selected from Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

- **Feature Engineering:** Features include URL length, presence of IP addresses, dash count, and other structural and linguistic signals.
